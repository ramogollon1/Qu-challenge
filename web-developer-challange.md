Objective: The objective of this challenge is not necessarily just to solve the problem - but to
evaluate your software development skills, code quality, creativity, and resourcefulness as a
potential future colleague. Please share the necessary artifacts you would provide to your
colleagues in a real-world professional setting.

We have a simple API that returns a JSON array. We would like you to use HTML, CSS and
Javascript to read the API and display it in an organized way. In addition, you should add in
some sort of sorting mechanic to the front-end. Use preferably Vue.js as base and feel free to
add any other framework or library you would consider necessary to achieve the task.

Feel free to use any data - but perhaps you can use the “planet” resource here.
There is no right answer - just looking for an understanding of how you interpret the assignment
and what decisions you make to build a simple project.
After finishing your code answer the following questions:

1. What's a closure? Where in the code is there a closure?
2. Which are the potential side-effects in any function? Could you point out any of these cases in
   your code? Are they expected? Can they be avoided?
